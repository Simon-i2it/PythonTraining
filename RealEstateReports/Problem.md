> Develop a program that can analyze their property data and generate reports.                        \
> The company has data for all the properties they manage, including the                              \
> property type, location, price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and square footage.               

> The program should be able to do the following:                                                     

> - Read the property data from a CSV file.                                                             

> 1. Calculate the average price and square footage of properties in each location.                      
> 2. Calculate the average number of bedrooms and bathrooms for each property type.                      

> 3. Generate a report that summarizes the data for each location and property type.                     
> The report should include the following information:                                                \
> The location and property type.                                                                     \
> The average price and square footage.                                                               \
> The average number of bedrooms and bathrooms.                                                       \
> The report should be saved to a PDF file.                                                           

> To complete this task, you will need to use Python libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation,  \
> `NumPy` for numerical computations, and `reportlab` for generating PDF files.                           \
> You will also need to have a good understanding of Python's file I/O operations and data structures.
